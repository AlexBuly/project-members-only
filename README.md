# project-members-only
In this project, I created an app that allows users to create accounts, login, post messages, and become an admin or a member. 

If when logged out, only messages are displayed on the home page and not the author or date of the message. When a user logs in, they can post a message but they cannot see the author or date of the message unless they become a member. If a user is not a member, a membership route is avaliable to them. If user submit the correct code, their status is changed to member true in the database. 

User can also become an admin by submitting the correct admin code. Admin can see authors and dates of messages as well as delete messages.
